# odin-sign-up-form

The aim of this project is to put my HTML knowledge of "forms" to the test, by building a sign-up form in accordance to the one provided by The Odin Project curriculum in the sign-up-form.png file.

To accomplish the task, I will be demonstrating my extensive knowledge of HTML forms, and the advanced CSS skills required to successfully style it.
